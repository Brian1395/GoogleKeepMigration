# GoogleKeepMigration

This is a simple script for copying existing Google Keep notes into a new Google account, using the unoffical gkeepapi (https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi). The program preserves all past information, including labels, checked elements of a list, and text formatting.

To use the program simply edit lines 4 and 7 of main.py to include your correct Google Account information. Then run the program using Python 3.6 or newer. Your previous notes should be added to your new account.
